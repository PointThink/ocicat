# Ocicat
Ocicat is a framework for making 2D games in C# and other .NET languages.

Ocicat provides an easy to use API for low-level features like graphics, audio etc.
Ocicat is **NOT** a game engine. It doesn't provide any fancy graphical editors. It's all raw C#.

## Examples
All examples are avialable in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pointThink/ocicat/tree/main/ocicat/Examples).
Please note that not all features might be in the examples.

## Tutorials
I plan to create text tutorials once the library has matured and stabilized.
I do not want the tutorials to be out of date after a few commits.
